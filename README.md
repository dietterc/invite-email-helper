# invite-email-helper
A python script to streamline sending out invites for the UofM CS discord server 



## Idea/Brainstorming:

CLI based  
Meant to be used along with the spreadsheet   
Given it a starting point in the spreadsheet, generate emails using the data gathered from the form (Spreadsheet)  
User will then be shown a list of the pre generated emails shown one at a time (arrow keys to go back and forth?)  
On each email preview the user will be able to scroll between previews, add the discord invite link, then send the email directly from the script.  
Process repeats until there are no more email previews   

Should skip over emails that aren't myumanitoba emails  
should make sure that there arent any repeated discord invite links   
should write back all used invite links to the spreadsheet once finished
